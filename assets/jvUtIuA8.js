Founded in 2021 by a group of friends and yoga teachers, InnerFlow started as a shared dream—to create a peaceful space in the heart of the city where people could reconnect with themselves, breathe deeply, and move with intention.</div><div class="loremIpsumDolor1" data-v-3590a0c6>Each of us came to yoga for different reasons: to heal, to slow down, to grow stronger, to find clarity. What we discovered was something deeper—a practice that connected body, mind, and spirit, and a community that supported us along the way. InnerFlow grew from those roots.</div></div><div class="imageAndText" data-v-3590a0c6><img class="image" alt="" src="'+v+'" data-v-3590a0c6><div class="textNextToImage" data-v-3590a0c6> Today, we offer a range of classes from dynamic Vinyasa flows to deeply restorative practices, guided by teachers who honor both tradition and personal transformation. Our studio is more than a place to stretch—it’s place to feel, to reflect, and to belong. Whether you&#39;re stepping onto the mat for the first time or deepening a lifelong practice, InnerFlow welcomes you. This is your space to move inward, breathe fully, and flow freely. </div></div></div>',1)),e("div",_,[t(r)])])}const b=n(h,[["render",g],["__scopeId","data-v-3590a0c6"]]);export{b as default};
