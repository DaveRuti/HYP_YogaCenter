Founded in 2021 by a group of friends and yoga teachers, InnerFlow started as a shared dream—to create a peaceful space in the heart of the city where people could reconnect with themselves, breathe deeply, and move with intention.</div><div class="loremIpsumDolor1" data-v-baa29797>Each of us came to yoga for different reasons: to heal, to slow down, to grow stronger, to find clarity. What we discovered was something deeper—a practice that connected body, mind, and spirit, and a community that supported us along the way. InnerFlow grew from those roots.</div></div><div class="imageAndText" data-v-baa29797><img class="image" alt="" src="'+v+'" data-v-baa29797><div class="textNextToImage" data-v-baa29797> Today, we offer a range of classes from dynamic Vinyasa flows to deeply restorative practices, guided by teachers who honor both tradition and personal transformation. Our studio is more than a place to stretch—it’s place to feel, to reflect, and to belong. Whether you&#39;re stepping onto the mat for the first time or deepening a lifelong practice, InnerFlow welcomes you. This is your space to move inward, breathe fully, and flow freely. </div></div></div>',1)),e("div",b,[t(r)])])}const y=n(h,[["render",_],["__scopeId","data-v-baa29797"]]);export{y as default};
